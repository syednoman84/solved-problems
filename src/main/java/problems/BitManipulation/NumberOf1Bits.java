/**
 * [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)
 * Easy
 *
 * Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
 * Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type.
 * In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type.
 * It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same,
 * whether it is signed or unsigned.
 * In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
 * Output: 31
 * Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - The input must be a binary string of length 32.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - Use n & (n-1) trick: this removes the rightmost 1 bit
 * - Keep doing this until n becomes 0
 * - Count the number of times we perform this operation
 *
 * Complexity Analysis:
 * - Time Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of 1 bits
 * - Space Complexity: O(1)
