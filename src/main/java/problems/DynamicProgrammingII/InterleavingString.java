/*
You are given three strings s1, s2, and s3. Return true if s3 is formed by interleaving s1 and s2 together or false otherwise.

Interleaving two strings s and t is done by dividing s and t into n and m substrings respectively, where the following conditions are met

    |n - m| <= 1, i.e. the difference between the number of substrings of s and t is at most 1.
    s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn
    t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm
    Interleaving s and t is s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + ... or t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + ...

You may assume that s1, s2 and s3 consist of lowercase English letters.

Example 1:
Input: s1 = "aaaa", s2 = "bbbb", s3 = "aabbbbaa"

Output: true

Explanation: We can split s1 into ["aa", "aa"], s2 can remain as "bbbb" and s3 is formed by interleaving ["aa", "aa"] and "bbbb".

Example 2:

Input: s1 = "", s2 = "", s3 = ""

Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "xyz", s3 = "abxzcy"

Output: false

Explanation: We can't split s3 into ["ab", "xz", "cy"] as the order of characters is not maintained.

Constraints:

    0 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100
    0 <= s3.length <= 200
